		Everyday well-being has a strong connection with mental well-being. When everything is good in
		your life, everyday life goes by without much effort. On the other hand, everyday things and a
		regular daily routine promote health. It is important to stop and think about how you cope in
		the best possible way in everyday life and what you can do yourself to cope even better. You can
		influence your own well-being with very simple, daily things. This section allows you to look at
		your own everyday life. What things could you change in your everyday life?

	<h1>Making everyday life meaningful</h1>

	<p>
		Any activity increases your sense of control in your life and promotes your well-being. Things
		to do and activities don't have to be anything big. Basic everyday things like cooking,
		exercising, cleaning and taking care of yourself are all activities. Doing the basics creates
		rhythm in everyday life and brings pleasure almost unnoticed. Participation in the work and
		student community and social relationships bring meaning to life. Exercise and other hobbies
		give pleasure. It is good to be balanced according to your own resources, talents and
		possibilities. Do you feel like you have enough meaningful things to do in your everyday life?
		If you answered "no", what kind of activities would you like to add to your life?
