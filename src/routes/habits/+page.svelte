		Everyday well-being has a strong connection with mental well-being. When everything is good in
		your life, everyday life goes by without much effort. On the other hand, everyday things and a
		regular daily routine promote health. It is important to stop and think about how you cope in
		the best possible way in everyday life and what you can do yourself to cope even better. You can
		influence your own well-being with very simple, daily things. This section allows you to look at
		your own everyday life. What things could you change in your everyday life?
	</h5>

	<h2>Making everyday life meaningful</h2>

	<p>
		Any activity increases your sense of control in your life and promotes your well-being. Things
		to do and activities don't have to be anything big. Basic everyday things like cooking,
		exercising, cleaning and taking care of yourself are all activities. Doing the basics creates
		rhythm in everyday life and brings pleasure almost unnoticed. Participation in the work and
		student community and social relationships bring meaning to life. Exercise and other hobbies
		give pleasure.
		<br />It is good to be balanced according to your own resources, talents and possibilities. Do
		you feel like you have enough meaningful things to do in your everyday life? If you answered
		"no", what kind of activities would you like to add to your life?
	</p>
	<h2>Exercise</h2>

	<p>
		Exercise has been found to have several health-promoting effects. Exercise can reduce symptoms
		of anxiety and depression and divert attention away from negative thoughts. Therefore, with
		regular exercise, you can maintain both physical fitness and mental well-being.
		<br />You don't have to reach the level of elite sports. Regularity is important in exercise: at
		least half an hour of exercise every day or longer a few times a week. Functional exercise is
		also counted as exercise. So you don't necessarily have to go to the gym or dance classes. For
		example, a brisk walk home from work is already exercise. Regular exercise also facilitates
		sleep. Are you moving enough? Would you like to increase the share of exercise in everyday life?
		If you don't have enough time, think about whether you could combine exercise and everyday
		routines. Could you walk part of your commute, manage social relationships while moving or go to
		the store on foot.
	</p>

	<h2>Food</h2>

	<p>
		Versatile nutrition maintains good performance. The brain is an important organ for human
		functioning. By eating well, you give your brain and body energy. Good eating habits improve
		concentration, coordination, motivation, memory and stress tolerance. Nutrition also plays a
		major role in mood.
		<br />A regular eating rhythm also sets the rhythm of the day. You should eat five times a day.
		<br />When you eat, focus on eating and enjoy it in peace. When you eat regularly, you keep your
		blood sugar balance, your state of alertness and your stamina steady throughout the day. Rarely
		have treat days.
		<br />In addition to eating, it is important to drink enough fluids. An adult should drink about
		1 Â½ to 2 liters of water a day.
	</p>

	<h2>Social relationships</h2>

	<p>
		Take care of your social relationships. The presence or contact of another person is important.
		Talking about things, working together or just being present reduces stress. Which people are
		important to you? Are you keeping in touch with them enough? Even one friend is precious. My
		family and relatives are important networks.
		<br />Do you miss new relationships? Establishing new social relationships can seem challenging
		at first. However, it is important to bravely go out and look at the surroundings. You can find
		new friends through studying or work. It is possible to meet people interested in the same
		things in hobbies, communities or clubs.
	</p>

	<h2>Sleep and relaxation</h2>

	<p>
		A person's natural need for sleep varies from individual to individual. A healthy adult needs an
		average of seven to eight hours of sleep per day. Good quality sleep is important for a person,
		because sleep is connected to a person's psychological and physical resources.
		<br />The most common cause of sleep disorders is stress and environmental and life changes.
		Disturbed sleep affects the body and mind in many ways. Poorly slept nights weaken the mood.
		Prolonged insomnia causes irritability and mood swings. Insomnia also weakens concentration and
		memory and makes learning difficult.
		<br />Insomnia also exposes you to many physical ailments. Prolonged lack of sleep can expose
		you to, for example, cardiovascular diseases.
		<br />For these reasons, it is important to take care of good sleep and adequate rest. Is your
		sleep and your need for sleep in balance? Below is a list of ways you can improve your sleeping
		habits:
