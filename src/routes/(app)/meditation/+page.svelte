		Your mind is all you have. Your mind determines every action taken and not taken. It is the
		place where emotions and qualities like happiness, joy, relaxation, creativity, compassion,
		anger, despair and sadness arise. Despite this, it's very easy to forget to take care of it. As
		a result, we become stressed and overwhelmed. Happily, there's a class of practices that have
		been used for thousands of years and recently scientifically researched. This class of practices
		is referred to as meditation. There are many different types of meditation, but they all share
		the same idea: focused attention. Mindfulness meditation is a popular form of meditation, in
		which you pay attention to the present moment in a relaxed, but focused manner. Mindfulness may
		alleviate depression, anxiety, stress, pain and it can promote happiness, relaxation and
		awareness. In truth, the list of benefits is endless and it is difficult to name a thing
		meditation does not improve.
